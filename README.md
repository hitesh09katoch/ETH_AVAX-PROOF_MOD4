# HITHEREUM AVALANCHE TESTNET

This is a basic contract implementing the erc 20 contract and it is deployed on the avalanche testnet blockchain. 

## Description

This contract is used to demonstrate the implementation of ERC20 contract by making a Degen Gaming Platform called Degen with DGN symbol.
We created the contract first of all by implementing ERC20 and adding 2 main functions viewItems and buyItem which shows us the items and lets us buy the items respectively.
Next once we did that, we created an account on snowtrace, got an API key and then deployed the contract to Avalanche Testnet which requires a few AVAX tokens which I should thank @MetacrafterChris for. Next we verify the contract and once that is done, we copy the contract, compile it on solidity ide Remix and deploy it using the contract to which it is deployed. 

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To deploy this contract, copy paste the Degen.sol to your remix ide and deploy the token using address of the contract where it was deployed earlier. You should also use Injected provider. Thne you can interact with the contract.
